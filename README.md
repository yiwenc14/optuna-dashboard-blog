## Step-by-Step Guide to Using Optuna Dashboard on Movie Ratings Data

In this guide, we’ll walk through setting up and using Optuna Dashboard to optimize a KNNWithMeans recommendation model on a movie ratings dataset. If you’re working with a different dataset or model, the steps are adaptable.

### 1. Setting Up the Environment

To start, make sure you have the required libraries installed. We’ll be using Optuna for optimization, the `surprise` library for the KNN model, and Pandas to manage our data.

```bash
pip install optuna scikit-surprise pandas optuna-dashboard
```

With these libraries installed, we’re ready to start coding!

### 2. Load and Explore the Data

For this tutorial, let’s assume you have a movie ratings dataset (`movie_ratings.csv`) with columns like `user_id`, `movie_id`, and `rating`. We’ll use the `surprise` library to load and structure this data for model training.

```python
import pandas as pd
from surprise import Dataset, Reader

# Load the movie ratings dataset
df = pd.read_csv('/path/to/your/movie_ratings.csv')
reader = Reader(rating_scale=(1, 5))
data = Dataset.load_from_df(df[['user_id', 'movie_id', 'rating']], reader)
```

This code snippet loads the dataset and prepares it for the `surprise` library’s KNN-based models.

### 3. Setting Up the Objective Function for Hyperparameter Optimization

In Optuna, the **objective function** defines what we’re optimizing—in this case, the mean RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of the KNNWithMeans model. Let’s set it up with some adjustable hyperparameters.

```python
from surprise import KNNWithMeans
from surprise.model_selection import cross_validate
import optuna

def objective(trial):
    # Suggest values for hyperparameters
    k = trial.suggest_int('k', 10, 50)
    min_k = trial.suggest_int('min_k', 1, 5)
    sim_options = {
        'name': trial.suggest_categorical('similarity', ['cosine', 'pearson']),
        'user_based': trial.suggest_categorical('user_based', [True, False])
    }

    # Initialize KNNWithMeans with suggested hyperparameters
    algo = KNNWithMeans(k=k, min_k=min_k, sim_options=sim_options)
    
    # Perform cross-validation
    result = cross_validate(algo, data, measures=['RMSE'], cv=3, verbose=False)
    
    # Return mean RMSE
    return result['test_rmse'].mean()
```

Here, we’re using Optuna to suggest values for the `k`, `min_k`, and `similarity` parameters. Each trial in Optuna will generate a new combination of these parameters, run cross-validation, and return the mean RMSE for that trial.

### 4. Creating and Running the Study

Now, we create an Optuna study and run it. This will execute multiple trials, each trying different combinations of hyperparameters.

```python
# Create a study with persistent storage
study = optuna.create_study(
    direction="minimize",
    storage="sqlite:///movie_recommendation_study.db",  # SQLite storage
    study_name="movie-recommendation-study",
    load_if_exists=True  # Load if the study already exists
)

# Run the study with the defined objective function
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=50)
```

This command starts the optimization process, which will run for 50 trials by default. If you’re looking for quick results, you can reduce the number of trials.

### 5. Launching Optuna Dashboard

Once the study is running, it’s time to launch Optuna Dashboard to visualize the tuning process.

Open a terminal and use the following command to start the dashboard:

```python
# Start the dashboard
!optuna-dashboard sqlite:///movie_recommendation_study.db --port 8080
```

The output will print **Listening on http://127.0.0.1:8080/** and you can open in your default browser to access it. 

### 6. Exploring the Dashboard

Here’s a quick tour of the Optuna Dashboard’s features:

- **Trials Table**: This table displays each trial, showing the parameter values and objective values. You can sort, filter, and explore individual trials to find the best-performing ones.
  # <place holder for image>
  
- **Parameter Importance**: This section ranks hyperparameters by their impact on model performance, which is helpful for identifying the most influential parameters. If, for example, `k` ranks highest, it may have the biggest effect on RMSE.
  # <place holder for image>

- **Parallel Coordinates**: This plot lets you explore relationships among multiple parameters. You can see how different combinations of `k`, `min_k`, and `similarity` impact the objective function, helping you spot potential interactions.
  # <place holder for image>

- **History and Intermediate Values**: The history tab shows the performance across trials, so you can track convergence. Intermediate values (if any) show progress within each trial, useful for early-stopping strategies.
  # <place holder for image>

Each view offers powerful insights, and you can include screenshots of these sections to show readers exactly what to expect!

### 7. Finalizing and Saving the Best Parameters

After running your study, Optuna provides an easy way to access the best parameters and score.

```python
best_trial = study.best_trial
print("Best RMSE: ", best_trial.value)
print("Best hyperparameters: ", best_trial.params)
```

Once you’ve identified the best parameters, you can integrate them into your model pipeline. Try running additional trials if you want to explore further, based on insights gained from the dashboard.

### 8. Next Steps

With Optuna Dashboard, you have a visually guided way to optimize your models. Here are a few suggestions for continuing your experimentation:

- Try the dashboard on different models to see how parameter importance shifts.
- Use the **Parallel Coordinates** plot to fine-tune relationships between hyperparameters.
- Integrate Optuna Dashboard into your regular workflow for a deeper understanding of complex models.

### Why Optuna Dashboard is Better than Optuna’s Legacy Visualization Tools

Optuna has always provided visualization features to analyze optimization results, but before the dashboard was introduced, these were limited to static plots generated in a Jupyter Notebook or script. While these legacy visualizations (like optimization history, parameter importance, and parallel coordinate plots) were helpful, they had several limitations that Optuna Dashboard has resolved:

1. **Interactive Exploration**:
   - Legacy visualization tools produced static images, which meant you could only view a single set of results without real-time interaction.
   - Optuna Dashboard, however, is fully interactive, allowing you to explore different views, filter trials, and zoom into specific sections. This interactivity gives you more flexibility to dive deep into results and find patterns that might be missed with static plots.

2. **Real-Time Monitoring**:
   - The **"Live Update"** option in Optuna Dashboard provides real-time monitoring. When enabled, the dashboard will automatically refresh to show new trial results as they are completed. This feature is especially useful when running a long optimization process, as you can watch the performance of each trial as it finishes and see how the objective (in this case, RMSE) improves over time.
   - With **Live Update** enabled, Optuna Dashboard continuously updates plots like the **History** plot, **Hyperparameter Importance**, and other analytics sections. This allows you to monitor trends, identify early signs of convergence, and adjust parameters or stop the study if you achieve satisfactory results before all trials are completed.
    
3. **Comprehensive Comparison Across Trials**:
   - Legacy plots were useful for analyzing individual aspects of the study, but comparing trials across different parameter combinations was not intuitive.
   - With Optuna Dashboard, you have a unified interface where you can compare all trials in one place. The **Trials Table** allows for easy sorting and filtering, while the **Parallel Coordinates** and **Parameter Importance** plots show relationships and the impact of each parameter on the objective function.

4. **Easier Workflow Integration**:
   - In Jupyter Notebooks, you often need to re-run cells or manage multiple plots to view different aspects of the study, which can be a hassle to maintain.
   - Optuna Dashboard consolidates all the information in a single interface, making it easier to integrate into your workflow. You simply start the dashboard, and all insights are accessible in one place without extra coding or re-running cells.

5. **Intuitive UI for All Experience Levels**:
   - Legacy visualizations require familiarity with Optuna’s plotting API and may be challenging for users who are new to Optuna or hyperparameter optimization.
   - The dashboard’s user-friendly, graphical interface lowers the barrier to entry, making it accessible for beginners while still powerful enough for advanced users.
